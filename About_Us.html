        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            Cuisineland’s cuisine draws influence largely from Indian dishes, <br>
            putting a twist on treasured classics and introducing modern culinary techniques <br>
            with the changing of the seasons. House-made cuisines and other hand-crafted ingredients  <br>
            abound in the from-scratch kitchen, and guests will taste the culinary team’s attention to detail in every bite.  <br>
            Staying true to Indian dining traditions.
        <br>
        <br>
            The restaurant’s open-concept dining room is anchored around the kitchen’s wood-burning oven, <br>
            reminiscent of the hearth in a family home. Accented by reclaimed barn wood and refined ceramic tile, <br>
            the modern space envelops guests in a welcoming atmosphere.
